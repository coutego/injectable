* Introduction
Injectable is a(nother) lightweight DI/IoC container for Clojure(script).

It is similar to Integrant in scope. Same as Integrant, it removes some
limitations from Component linked to the decision to favour inmutable records.
Injectable, like Integrant, doesn't impose this limitation, giving a more natural
injection mechanism and even allowing for circular dependencies.

Unlike Integrant, the implementation does not depend on multimethods, but in
plain functions. This is a matter of style and it doesn't prevent the mechanism
for building the objects to be externalised from the configuration of the system.

This library takes inspiration in the Spring container. The configurable elements are named
'beans' in the codebase due to this fact."

* Why
This question can mean different things:
- Why another DI library?
- Why DI in Clojure?
- Why DI at all?

These are my personal replies to those questions.

** Why another DI library?
There are stablished DI libraries in Clojure. The main ones are Component and
Integrant. Mount is usually considered a DI library, although it doesn't seem DI
to me, but a kind of service locator.

The reason to not use any of these three is that the use case of Injectable is
different: make it as easy as possible the creation of containers with high
number of managed elements. This is needed when embracing DI to its fullest,
where many or even most functions used in the application are managed via the
container.

** Why DI in Clojure
DI is a technique which is used in OO systems. The technique itself is
not linked to OO and it has a place in FP (see, for example
https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/dependency-injection-1/). This technique
is less relevant in Clojure since most of the application can be implemented as
pure functions operating in immutable data. Nevertheless, it's quite typical
that some parts of the applications depend on state and, unfortunately, the
common approach is to use that state directly or indirectly in most of the code
of the application. This is usual the case in parts of the code dealing with
databases (or files, services, ...) and parts dealing with UI state.

Injectable offers an alternative solution based in DI which is light enough to
manage as to offer little overhead while allowing all the code to consist in
"pure" functions that depend only on their input parameters and nothing else.
This makes a huge difference in terms of local reasoning and testability.

** Why DI at all?
In short: local reasoning.

DB people understand the importance of normalization, both in practice as in
theory (since the concept was first defined mathematically). Normalization is a
case of a more fundamental principle: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).

Local reasoning is an even more general and fundamental principle of
programming. It consists in having the absolute certainty of the effects of a
change in the code of configuration, independently of whatever else is done in
the rest of the codebase.

Pure functions in FP automatically allow for this local reasoning: as long as my
function doesn't perform any impure operations and, therefore, only uses the
parameters given to it, then I can reason about it. The only thing that I depend
on with the rest of the code base is how the codebase is calling my function.
This is simply a problem of clearly defining the interface.

Functions that only depend on their arguments, but allow those arguments to be
impure (i.e. side effectful) are similar to pure functions in that they allow
for local reasoning: if called with the same parameters (with the same state, in
case they are stateful!) then they produce the same result. It's easy to reason
about those functions and test them. I call these functions "almost pure"
functions.

Functions that internally are implemented by calling impure functions themselves are
basically evil and should be avoided as much as possible. It's very difficult to reason
about them, because they are stateful . They are difficult to test and they also
depend on the order of initialization of the different parts of the codebase,
since calling those parts produce side effects.

DI allows us to define all the functions in our codebase to be "almost pure" a
and be simply left with the problem of using external impure functions, which
will be passed to our "almost pure" functions.

The strategy for implementation is, therefore
1. Check whether you can achieve your objective using pure functions. If so, do
  it.
2. Check whether you can achieve your objective using almost pure functions. If
   so, do it and use DI to inject whatever impure functions are needed as
   parameters.
3. If you can't achieve your objective with 1. or 2. then encapsulate your state
   and external impure functions, exposing the operations to (safely) operate in
   that state as impure functions to be injected in the normal functions.

This is the most powerful and simple way to allow for local reasoning in
practice that I know of.

* How
The DI container is extremely minimalist. It's defined in the ~container.cljc~
file. It uses a very simple, but impractical, format to define "systems". Every
element (I call them "beans", as a reference to the fabulous Spring container,
which pioneered the technique in Java) is defined as an entry on a map of the
form:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def conf
  {:element1 {:constructor [(fn [] "Value of element1")]
   :element2 {:constructor [(fn [k]
              (str "Element2 references element1, which has a value: ")
                   :element1]})
#+END_SRC

Needless to say, this way of defining elements is not practical.

There is a second way of defining elements, which gets internally translated to
this simplified form. In this way, vaguely inspired by the Hiccup syntax, the
previous configuration would be expressed as this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def conf
  {:element1 "Value of element1"]
   :element2 [str "Element2 references element1, which has a value: "
                  :element1])
#+END_SRC

Another less simplistic example follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def conf
  {:db-user        "john-doe" ; (1)
   :db-pass        "hunter2"
   :db-conn        [create-db-conn :db-user :db-pass] ; (2)
   :all-products   [all-products :db-conn '?query] ; (3)
   :delete-product [delete-product :db-conn '?id]
   :my-products    [:all-products [:= :user-products-query]] ; (4)
   :ui-template    [ui-template :ui-top-bar '?main-content]
   :ui-main-page   [:ui-template [:=bean> [ui-main-page-component]]]}) ; (5)

; (1) Simple value
; (2) Function create-db-conn is called on bean refs :db-user and :db-pass
; (3) A function of 1 parameter is assigned to :all-products
; (4) [= x] Notation for literal value, x is passed raw
;     Note that the bean ref :all-products is on function position
; (5) Inner beans: avoid having to define another bean
#+END_SRC

Another more complex example taking from a sample web application in development

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def conf
  {:main-component   [:ui-page-template default-content]
   ::top-row         [ui-top-row
                      ::app-icon
                      ::app-name
                      ::topbar-center
                      ::topbar-right
                      ::on-logo-click]
   ::app-icon        [:= [:div "*app-icon*"]]
   ::app-name        [:= [:div "*app-name*"]]
   ::topbar-center   [:= [:div.ui.text.container
                          [ui-top-row-entry nil [:i.ui.upload.icon] "Upload"]
                          [ui-top-row-entry nil [:i.ui.clock.icon] "Recent"]
                          [ui-top-row-entry
                           nil
                           [:i.ui.envelope.icon]
                           "Notifications"
                           [:span.ui.label {:style {:font-size :xx-small}} 2]]]]
   ::topbar-right    [ui-login-top-row]
   :ui-page-template [ui-page-template ::top-row '?]})
#+END_SRC

You get the idea.
