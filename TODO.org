* TODO Add the possibility to stop a "system"
- Mutators allow to implement initialization code for beans.
- In order to support cleanup of resources, a stop mechanism (similar to
  Component or Integrant) is needed.
- The idea is to define a function which is able to stop the system, for those
  beans that define a stop function
** Open points
1. How to define the stop function?
   1. Idea: by making the bean implement a protocol (as Component) (-> too restrictive)
   2. Idea: by introducing some new keyword (e.g. '[:=stop>') in the bean definition
2. How to store the function in the started container?
   1. Idea: as metainformation on the system map
* TODO Improve error handling and reporting
- Errors are not intuitive
- It's not trivial to debug a container, especially if hte user doesn't know the
  details of ~Injectable~.
